# An LDA Topic Analysis: How the WHO and Trump framed the COVID-19 Pandemic

#### Project for the course Human Language Technlogies (2022-23). Master's degree in Computational and Theoretical modelling of Language and Cognition - Cognitive Science, CiMeC, University of Trento, Italy.

This project presents an analysis of the discourse around Covid-19, based on a corpus of
speeches given by the two relevant public figures: the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus and former President of the United States of America Donald Trump, during the first
two months of the pandemic (March-April 2020). Using topic modelling, it was first analysed the
topics around which the discourse about Covid-19 can be classified. Then, it was investigated to
what extent the discourse was framed figuratively, in terms of a WAR and JOURNEY metaphors,
which have been pervasive in healthcare discourse when talking about diseases and viruses. Finally,
this project explored the connection between these frames and topics, showing a relative tendency
to employ the WAR frame to discuss safety measures and treatment, while the JOURNEY frame
to discuss topics related to the population and patients. However, it is important to note that the
boundaries between these frames and topics are fuzzy and they often overlap and intersect with
one another.
